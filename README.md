# 📚 Assignment - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Simple RAG 🧠
- Implemented a basic RAG pipeline from scratch.
- Used a simple retrieval strategy to fetch relevant chunks from the document.
- Applied a language model to generate answers based on retrieved chunks.

### 2. Optimized RAG with DSPy 🚀
- Enhanced the RAG pipeline using [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy).
- Leveraged DSPy’s declarative programming approach to optimize retrieval and generation steps.
- Achieved better semantic retrieval and more accurate answers with minimal manual tuning.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍
- DSPy
- LangChain
- Chromadb 
- GROQ API & TOGETHER API
